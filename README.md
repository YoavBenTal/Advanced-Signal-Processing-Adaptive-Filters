# Advanced Signal Processing – Adaptive Filters

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of adaptive filtering techniques, developed as part of coursework in Advanced Signal Processing. The scripts demonstrate practical applications of adaptive algorithms such as LMS and RLS.

## Files
- **ASP_Adaptive_Filters_Q1.m** – Basic adaptive filter setup and analysis.  
- **ASP_Adaptive_filters_Q2.m** – Adaptive filtering with additional scenarios.  
- **ASP_Adaptive_Filters_Q4.m** – Simulation of adaptive filter convergence behavior.  
- **ASP_Adaptive_Filters_Q5_RLS.m** – Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive filter implementation.  

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020a or newer recommended)  
- Signal Processing Toolbox  

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the `.m` files directly in MATLAB:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoavBenTal/Advanced-Signal-Processing-Adaptive-Filters.git
cd Advanced-Signal-Processing-Adaptive-Filters
